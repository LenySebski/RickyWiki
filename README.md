# Ricky Wiki (no offense Morty...)

[LIVE version] (https://61a43fea14ce8a00079bfe56--awesome-wilson-815943.netlify.app/)

### The 'React with API' assignment

I've decided to recreate the Rick and Morty Wiki. I thought that this project will cover most of interesting and basic topics like usage of States, Effects, Fetching data, handling form inputs, pagination, react router and styling.

Definitely it helped me with better understanding of:
- destructuring 
- react routing 
- mapping fetched data


 on the top of this tutorials I decided to add:

 - more practical and readable list of episodes and locations 
 - and my own boring, grey styling
